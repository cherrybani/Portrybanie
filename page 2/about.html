         <p class="typing-text">Hello!! my name's Cherry Geva Raya Rabbani, and my aspiration is to become a computer 
           scientist who develop impactful technologies. From early age, i was fascinated by computeters. 
           this is the reason why i was choose computer and network engineering as my major in vocational high 
           school. i finally had opportunity to study programming. i created several websites, from personal 
           portofolios and notes which allowed me not only to sharpen my technical skills but also to understand
           the real-world applications of informatics. Each websites i build thought me how to programming, can 
           translate ideas into reality. this motivate me to use my skills to create meaningful lsolutions that 
           benefit society. 

           i'm not just going to talk about how much i love computers I also wanna share a bit about what i like.
           First, I really like K-pop. I listen to many K-pop songs, and my fav are "No Doubt" by Enhypen and "HOT"
           by Le Sserafim. Both are my fav K-pop Idols. I also like K-dramas and C-dramas, my recent Fav are "Head 
           Over Heels" and "The Best Thing".

           I also enjoy manhwa and manhua. My fav fictional characters are Shiyan and Regis, both are sexy, Handsome,
           and yap Rich. I,m not only into korean or chinese dramas and songs. I also like western music. I think 
           listening music to relaz or escape the world I also use it to learn a new language.

           Okay. I'll stop here because i've been talking too much. I'll tell yo another fun fact about me if we get 
           closer. SEE YOU THERE!!!
